<p>Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical, The Phantom of the Opera, premiered in London’s West End in 1986, and has since become the most successful entertainment event and second longest-running musical of all time, with a gross of $5.9 billion over 29 years.</p>

<p>The history behind the musical is a long one, starting in 1910 with French author Gaston Leroux’s novel by the same name, which Leroux based on various urban legends surrounding Paris’ Palais Garnier.</p>

<p>The show has a worldwide following, with official shows in Europe, Turkey and China. Additionally, for the musical’s 25th anniversary, licensing became available for productions.</p>

<p>Previously, the musical’s US tour came to Tempe, Arizona in 1994 at Arizona State University’s Grady Gammage Auditorium; now it returns for the first time in more than 20 years, running from May 27 to June 9, 2015.</p>

<p>Such a major event impacts the local economy, generating revenue for the surrounding businesses.</p>
