Additionally, for the musical’s 25th anniversary, licensing became available for productions.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the musical’s US tour came to Tempe, Arizona in 1994 at Arizona State University’s Grady Gammage Auditorium; now it returns for the first time in more than 20 years, running from May 27 to June 9, 2015.\r\n\r\nSuch a major event impacts the local economy, generating revenue for the surrounding businesses.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
